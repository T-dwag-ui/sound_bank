// A curated pool of common chord voicings: the common chord qualities, each
// with every chord tone taken as the bass (root position plus inversions). The
// complement to the reviewed-oracle corpus: that set is deliberately adversarial
// edge cases, this approximates the structures of real playing.
//
// Only one root (C) per quality is included on purpose. Analysis is
// transposition-invariant when the key moves with the chord (see
// theory_transposition_property_test), so the same quality on a different root
// is structurally identical and would only inflate the pool. (At a fixed key the
// root does affect diatonic tie-breakers, but that is a key-interaction axis,
// not common-chord performance, and belongs in a deliberately-keyed probe or the
// oracle corpus.) Inversions are kept because the bass is a real structural
// variable, not a transposition.
//
// It is a fixture, not generated, so the set is stable and the numbers stay
// comparable. Keep the qualities list to genuinely common chords; add rare or
// synthetic shapes to the oracle corpus instead.
//
// Provenance: the qualities are the standard lead-sheet vocabulary, picked by
// hand rather than emitted from data. Cross-checking after the fact, every entry
// maps to a high-frequency key in the ChoCo common-name prior
// (lib/.../analysis/choco_common_name_prior.dart), so the pool lines up with
// observed corpus frequency without being mechanically derived from it. A few
// chords ranking above some of these in ChoCo are intentionally omitted, all
// altered dominants (dominant7|flat9, dominant7Sharp5, dominant7sus4): they lean
// adversarial and belong with the oracle corpus, not the common pool.
