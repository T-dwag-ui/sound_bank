## The Basic Idea

Most chord symbols start from a
[stack of thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertian). Pick a candidate root,
then lay out the chord-member letter names above it:

<div class="member-stack-scroll">
  <table class="member-stack">
    <caption>
      Tertian Slots Above C
    </caption>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Note names</th>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>E</td>
        <td>G</td>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>D</td>
        <td>F</td>
        <td>A</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Degree numbers</th>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>9</td>
        <td>11</td>
        <td>13</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

The numbers do not describe register. In chord-symbol language, a D right next
to middle C and a D two octaves higher are both the ninth above C. The stack is
a naming map: each letter slot has a default quality, and the actual note either
matches that default or alters it.

## Default Interval Qualities

The plain degree numbers in the stack name the positions: third, fifth, seventh,
ninth, and so on. They do not by themselves tell you the final accidental. The
note letter comes from the position in the stack, and the interval quality tells
you whether that letter is natural, lowered, or raised.

Above C, for example, the seventh slot is always some kind of B. B is the major
seventh, B♭ is the minor seventh, and B𝄫 is the diminished seventh. It does not
become A just because it has been lowered; changing the letter would move it
into a different slot.

Chord symbols have defaults for those interval qualities.

<table class="article-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Chord member</th>
      <th scope="col">Default above C</th>
      <th scope="col">Lowered</th>
      <th scope="col">Raised</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>3rd</td>
      <td>E, major</td>
      <td>E♭, minor (<code>m</code>)</td>
      <td>E♯, <span class="unused">augmented</span><sup>*</sup></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5th</td>
      <td>G, perfect</td>
      <td>G♭, diminished (<code>♭5</code>, <code>dim</code>)</td>
      <td>G♯, augmented (<code>♯5</code>, <code>aug</code>)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7th</td>
      <td>B♭, minor (<code>7</code>)</td>
      <td>B𝄫, diminished (<code>dim7</code>)</td>
      <td>B, major (<code>maj7</code>)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>9th</td>
      <td>D, major</td>
      <td>D♭, minor (<code>♭9</code>)</td>
      <td>D♯, augmented (<code>♯9</code>)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>11th</td>
      <td>F, perfect</td>
      <td>F♭, <span class="unused">diminished</span><sup>*</sup></td>
      <td>F♯, augmented (<code>♯11</code>)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>13th</td>
      <td>A, major</td>
      <td>A♭, minor (<code>♭13</code>)</td>
      <td>A♯, <span class="unused">augmented</span><sup>*</sup></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="article-table-note">
  <span class="fn-mark">*</span> Chord symbols never use these three
  qualities. Each is enharmonically a plainer chord member, so the
  simpler spelling always wins: a raised 3rd (E♯) is the perfect 11th
  (F), a lowered 11th (F♭) is the major 3rd (E), and a raised 13th
  (A♯) is the minor 7th (B♭).
</p>

The third is major by default, unless `m` makes it minor. The fifth and eleventh
are perfect by default, unless altered. Every default here matches the major
scale except the seventh: the bare `7` means the lowered, minor seventh, so
<span class="chord">C7</span> is C-E-G-B♭, not C-E-G-B. The word `maj` changes
only that seventh, so <span class="chord">Cmaj7</span> means C-E-G-B, while
<span class="chord">Cm7</span> changes the third to E♭ but leaves the seventh at
its default B♭.

Diminished and augmented are interval qualities too. A diminished interval is
one semitone smaller than minor or perfect. An augmented interval is one
semitone larger than major or perfect. Chord labels use those interval qualities
as shortcuts: <span class="chord">Cdim</span> means a minor third plus a
diminished fifth, C-E♭-G♭. <span class="chord">Cdim7</span> adds a diminished
seventh, B𝄫. A half-diminished seventh chord,
<span class="chord">Cm7(♭5)</span>, keeps the default minor seventh and lowers
only the fifth. <span class="chord">Caug</span> means an augmented triad:
C-E-G♯.

## From Degrees to Quality Names

Once the notes are mapped to degree numbers, the chord quality comes from the
pattern those degrees make. A few common patterns do most of the work:

<table class="article-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Quality</th>
      <th scope="col">Degree formula</th>
      <th scope="col">Example on C</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Major triad</td>
      <td><code>1, 3, 5</code></td>
      <td><span class="chord">C</span> = C-E-G</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Minor triad</td>
      <td><code>1, ♭3, 5</code></td>
      <td><span class="chord">Cm</span> = C-E♭-G</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Diminished triad</td>
      <td><code>1, ♭3, ♭5</code></td>
      <td><span class="chord">Cdim</span> = C-E♭-G♭</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Augmented triad</td>
      <td><code>1, 3, ♯5</code></td>
      <td><span class="chord">Caug</span> = C-E-G♯</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dominant seventh</td>
      <td><code>1, 3, 5, ♭7</code></td>
      <td><span class="chord">C7</span> = C-E-G-B♭</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Major seventh</td>
      <td><code>1, 3, 5, 7</code></td>
      <td><span class="chord">Cmaj7</span> = C-E-G-B</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Minor seventh</td>
      <td><code>1, ♭3, 5, ♭7</code></td>
      <td><span class="chord">Cm7</span> = C-E♭-G-B♭</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Half-diminished seventh</td>
      <td><code>1, ♭3, ♭5, ♭7</code></td>
      <td><span class="chord">Cm7(♭5)</span> = C-E♭-G♭-B♭</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fully diminished seventh</td>
      <td><code>1, ♭3, ♭5, 𝄫7</code></td>
      <td><span class="chord">Cdim7</span> = C-E♭-G♭-B𝄫</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dominant ninth</td>
      <td><code>1, 3, 5, ♭7, 9</code></td>
      <td><span class="chord">C9</span> = C-E-G-B♭-D</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Added ninth</td>
      <td><code>1, 3, 5, 9</code></td>
      <td><span class="chord">Cadd9</span> = C-E-G-D</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Extensions vs. Added Tones

A seventh turns upper notes into extensions. With the seventh present, D above C
is a ninth, F is an eleventh, and A is a thirteenth. Without the seventh, those
same notes are added tones or sixths: <span class="chord">C9</span> includes B♭,
while <span class="chord">Cadd9</span> does not.

The thirteenth has one common naming exception. If there is no seventh, an A
above C is written as a sixth: <span class="chord">C6</span>. Add the seventh
and that same chord member becomes a thirteenth: <span class="chord">C13</span>.

## Slash Bass

The bass note is the lowest sounding note. When the bass is not the root of the
chord name, chord symbols write it after a slash: <span class="chord">C9 /
E</span> means C dominant ninth with E in the bass. The slash note is not a
second chord, and it does not change the root. It only tells the player what
note is underneath the chord.

If the bass is already the root, no slash note is needed. A C dominant ninth
with C in the bass is simply <span class="chord">C9</span>, not
<span class="chord not-used">C9 / C</span>.

## How to Name a Chord

A practical naming pass looks like this:

1. List the sounding [pitch classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class)
   and the bass note. Ignore doublings, but keep the lowest note for slash-bass
   decisions.
2. Try candidate roots. Usually those are notes already present in the chord,
   plus obvious enharmonic spellings when they make the tertian stack cleaner.
3. For each root, write the `1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13` letter stack.
4. Place each sounding note into its letter slot, respelling enharmonically when
   the chord function demands it.
5. Prefer names with a clear triad or seventh-chord base, fewer awkward
   alterations, and no unnecessary slash bass.

The result is not always unique. Some pitch sets really do have several good
names, and musical context may decide between them. But this process gives you a
disciplined way to find the names that are musically defensible before choosing
the most readable one.

## Worked Example

Suppose the sounding notes are C-E-G-B♭-D, with C in the bass. The goal is to
work from the notes toward a name, not to assume the name first. C is a good
root to test because it is in the bass, and the notes above it include the
familiar C-E-G shape.

Start by stacking thirds above C through the ninth:

<div class="member-stack-scroll">
  <table class="member-stack">
    <caption>
      Tertian Slots Above C
    </caption>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Note names</th>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>E</td>
        <td>G</td>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>D</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Degree numbers</th>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>9</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

Now compare the sounding notes to those slots. C-E-G gives a major triad because
the third is E, not E♭. The seventh slot above C is some kind of B; the sounding
note is B♭, which is the default minor seventh. A major triad plus the default
minor seventh is written <span class="chord">C7</span>, not
<span class="chord">Cm7</span>, because nothing has made the third minor. D is
in the ninth slot. Because the seventh is present, that D is an extension rather
than an added tone.

<div class="member-stack-scroll">
  <table class="member-stack">
    <caption>
      Sounding Notes Interpreted Above C
    </caption>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Note names</th>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>E</td>
        <td>G</td>
        <td>B♭</td>
        <td>D</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Degree numbers</th>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>♭7</td>
        <td>9</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

That points to <span class="chord">C9</span>: the seventh is present, so it is
not <span class="chord">Cadd9</span>, and the bass is C, so no slash note is
needed. Before committing to it, though, a thorough pass should weigh the other
roots.

## Trying Other Roots

For this note set, the candidate roots are the notes that are actually sounding:
C-E-G-B♭-D.

Try E next. The letter stack above E is E-G-B-D-F-A-C. The sounding notes then
map as E-G-B♭-D-C:

<div class="member-stack-scroll">
  <table class="member-stack">
    <caption>
      Sounding Notes Interpreted Above E
    </caption>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Note names</th>
        <td>E</td>
        <td>G</td>
        <td>B♭</td>
        <td>D</td>
        <td>C</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Degree numbers</th>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>♭3</td>
        <td>♭5</td>
        <td>♭7</td>
        <td>♭13</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

That gives an E half-diminished seventh shape: `1, ♭3, ♭5, ♭7`. The remaining C
is the lowered thirteenth above E, and it is also the bass, so the full name
spells out both facts: <span class="chord">Em7(♭5,♭13) / C</span>. That is
valid, but it is already more complex than the C-rooted name: it needs an
altered fifth, an altered thirteenth, and slash bass, while the C reading gave a
direct dominant ninth.

Doing the same check for each sounding note gives this comparison:

<table class="article-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Root tested</th>
      <th scope="col">Note names in stack order</th>
      <th scope="col">Degree numbers</th>
      <th scope="col">Candidate name</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>C</td>
      <td>C-E-G-B♭-D</td>
      <td><code>1, 3, 5, ♭7, 9</code></td>
      <td><span class="chord">C9</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>E</td>
      <td>E-G-B♭-D-C</td>
      <td><code>1, ♭3, ♭5, ♭7, ♭13</code></td>
      <td><span class="chord">Em7(♭5,♭13) / C</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>G</td>
      <td>G-B♭-D-C-E</td>
      <td><code>1, ♭3, 5, 11, 13</code></td>
      <td><span class="chord">Gm6 / C</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>B♭</td>
      <td>B♭-D-C-E-G</td>
      <td><code>1, 3, 9, ♯11, 13</code></td>
      <td><span class="chord">B♭6♯11 / C</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>D</td>
      <td>D-C-E-G-B♭</td>
      <td><code>1, ♭7, 9, 11, ♭13</code></td>
      <td><span class="chord">D9sus4(♭13) / C</span></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Those names are not equally useful. The C reading has a complete, familiar base
chord: `1, 3, 5, ♭7`, then one ordinary ninth. The alternatives need more
explanation: they lack a complete triad or seventh-chord base, depend on several
upper extensions or altered degrees, or require slash bass to account for C
underneath them.

The C reading wins because it has the strongest base chord, the bass is the
root, and the remaining note has a standard name as a ninth. Deciding which
reading is "best" can still be tricky, especially in real music where context
matters, but this is the kind of comparison that makes one option much easier to
justify than the others.

## Why Spelling Matters

The spelling is not cosmetic. In this example, B♭ is the seventh above C.
Spelling the same physical piano key as A♯ would make it look like some kind of
altered sixth instead of the chord's seventh. Both spellings represent the same
pitch class, but chord symbols use
[enharmonic spelling](why-chord-naming-is-hard.html#enharmonic-spelling) to show
function, not just keys on the instrument.

## How WhatChord Uses This Idea

WhatChord evaluates candidate roots and qualities in software rather than by
hand. It assigns each candidate an explanation cost based on musical fit: stable
triads and seventh chords, sensible extensions, spelling that fits the chord
member, and bass relationships that musicians expect to read. Close alternatives
can still appear when the notes genuinely support more than one interpretation.

The app asks the same questions a player asks: What is the root? What is the
base quality? Which notes are extensions or alterations? Is the bass part of the
chord or a slash note? Which spelling makes the stack readable?

For the implementation details behind those costs, see
[Building a Real-Time Chord Recognizer](chord-recognition-algorithm.html).
