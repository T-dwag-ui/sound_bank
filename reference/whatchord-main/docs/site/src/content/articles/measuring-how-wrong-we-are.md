## A promising idea is not a result

WhatChord watches the notes arriving from a MIDI keyboard and tries to
[name the chord](why-chord-naming-is-hard.html), infer the key, and keep both
answers readable while human hands are rolling notes and leaning on the sustain
pedal. It is the sort of problem that produces wonderfully plausible ideas.

Surely the previous chord will clarify this one. Surely a
[cadence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence) will reveal the key. Surely
notes held only by the pedal are safe to ignore. Surely a more sophisticated
probability model will outperform the simple one. Surely.

We have built and measured all of those ideas. Many did not help. Several did
exactly what they promised and still made the app worse. A few revealed that we
were trying to fix the wrong layer entirely.

That is good news.

A negative result can save users from a regression, save the codebase from a new
mechanism it must carry forever, and save the next round of research from
repeating an attractive dead end. But it can do those things only if somebody
can tell what was tested, against what, and under which rules. "We tried it
once" is an anecdote. A reproducible negative result is reusable knowledge.

<div class="callout">
  <p>
    Research rarely proves that an idea can never work. It can show that a
    specific mechanism, tested on declared data against a declared baseline,
    did not improve the thing it claimed to improve enough to justify shipping.
    That narrower statement is still extremely useful.
  </p>

## How we arrange to lose an argument with ourselves

For each serious investigation, we write down the question, the measurements,
and the adoption bar before running the experiment. When an idea needs tuning,
we divide the music itself into two sets, keeping every work whole so that no
sonata or song lands half on each side: a development set, where ideas may be
refined, and a held-out set that stays sealed until the final configuration is
fixed.

When testing a proposed change, we run both the current system and the changed
system on the same music. We measure the difference separately for each piece,
then compare those per-piece results. That keeps one unusually long sonata from
counting as more evidence than many shorter works. We record the exact commands,
code versions, corpus versions, and any known limits of the labels. The same
instinct governs
[how we benchmark speed](benchmarking-on-hardware-you-dont-control.html), where
the harder problem is trusting the measurement rather than making the change.

The music we measure against is deliberately broad: classical scores and
performances, annotated pop and rock, jazz solos and comping voicings, and
targeted blues and modal examples. An idea that wins in one tradition still has
to be checked against other traditions for regressions before it becomes a
default.

Most importantly, each investigation keeps a dated log of null results,
reversals, and corrections. This has already caught our own mistakes: a research
harness whose command-line default had drifted from the detector's own,
performed-music labels aligned to the wrong moments, and two research tools
quietly broken by a file move. Each surfaced because the record was specific
enough for a later run to disagree with it, and because a disagreement was
treated as a finding rather than a nuisance. Reproducibility is not just a
courtesy to a future reader. It is an alarm system for the present.

## The cabinet of extremely reasonable ideas

The full record lives in the
[research archive](https://github.com/EarthmanMuons/whatchord/tree/main/research).
Here are the thirty-two ideas we measured and did not adopt as proposed, in
plain English, including a few that later found a narrower job.

### Surely more music theory will help

These experiments come from the
[WhatKey](https://github.com/EarthmanMuons/whatchord/tree/main/research/whatkey)
and
[WhatKey Local](https://github.com/EarthmanMuons/whatchord/tree/main/research/whatkey-local)
investigations.

- **Score each chord by its harmonic function.** Rules such as "a dominant
  seventh strongly suggests this key" handled tidy textbook examples but lost to
  a simpler summary of the notes on real scores. In the calm section-key
  detector they were eventually removed, improving accuracy and stopping each
  blues seventh from sounding like a move to another key.

- **Reward familiar chord progressions.** Cadences and
  [ii-V-I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ii%E2%80%93V%E2%80%93I_progression)
  patterns helped an older detector speak more often, but added no useful
  information to the probability model that replaced it. At reactive settings
  they also destabilized blues and
  [secondary dominants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_chord).

- **Trust the chord recognizer's confidence.** Down-weighting uncertain chord
  names sounded tailor-made for messy live input. On clean scores and performed
  piano, at both stable and reactive settings, it changed nothing useful. Six
  null results closed it.

- **Reward the chord that sounds like home.** A gentle dose did nothing; a
  stronger dose partially fixed the blues while making classical pieces worse.
  Recognizing that the music has returned to its home key requires knowing what
  came before, and no rule examining one chord in isolation can supply that. The
  diagnosis is what argued for the detector we adopted next, which keeps a
  running belief about the key instead of re-arguing it at every chord.

- **Nudge between a key and its relative.** We tried leaning between
  [relative major and minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_key) using
  the bass, a preceding cadence, and the recent presence or absence of
  minor-defining notes. The signals were inert, too weak, or actively mislabeled
  ordinary minor passages between cadences.

- **Swap in a different published key profile.** A key profile is the standard
  table of which notes a key tends to use, and several well-known ones exist.
  Some beat ours on the classical corpus, then called both blues examples by the
  wrong key and stopped answering on a
  [Dorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_mode) vamp. A single corpus win
  was not a win for players.

- **Assume the first chord is home.** Jazz progressions often start on the
  second degree of the scale, and modal openings exist, so the assumption
  created confident early mistakes. The successful fix was simpler: remove an
  arbitrary three-chord waiting rule and let the existing uncertainty threshold
  decide whether the first chord was informative.

### Surely a smarter memory will help

Also from WhatKey and WhatKey Local:

- **Forget the past faster.** The detector's evidence for a key fades as it
  goes, and speeding that up caught more key changes, exactly as expected. It
  also invented more key changes. The accuracy gain did not survive held-out
  music. Later work let us re-adopt the trade-off honestly in the Key Detection
  setting's Stable, Balanced, and Reactive options: the modes offer different
  degrees of responsiveness, not progressively better accuracy.

- **Wait for a new key to win twice.** This calmed a few false switches, but the
  extra wait was long enough to miss the short real key changes that faster
  memory had recovered. The rule cost more than it bought every time we retested
  it.

- **Forget by the chord instead of by the clock.** We tried aging the evidence
  by chords elapsed rather than by seconds elapsed. Nothing moved. Chords taken
  from clean scores still wanted to be trusted individually, and chords from
  pedaled performances still wanted heavy averaging. The disagreement was about
  how far to trust each observation, not about the units used to age it.

- **Model how long keys actually last.** We first swept the simpler "how long do
  keys usually last?" knob across an enormous range. The output barely cared,
  leaving little for an explicit-duration model to improve. That measured
  ceiling saved us from building the larger model.

- **Let the detector infer when a new musical section begins.** Adaptive
  changepoint detection found real changes faster and was genuinely better in
  the most reactive regime. It also mistook colorful harmony for a succession of
  new sections. No setting matched the calm accuracy and stability the app was
  designed to show.

- **Give each behavior mode more tuning knobs.** We tested separate controls for
  memory, decisiveness, and uncertainty. Most reproduced the same responsiveness
  trade-off less cleanly than one understandable memory control, so they stayed
  shared defaults.

### Surely the surrounding chords will rescue the name

These ideas were measured in
[Chord Context](https://github.com/EarthmanMuons/whatchord/tree/main/research/chord-context)
and the later
[Ensemble Tiebreak](https://github.com/EarthmanMuons/whatchord/tree/main/research/ensemble-tiebreak)
work.

- **Prefer the expected resolution, dominant, or previous root.** Knowing the
  previous chord mostly added no information beyond the current notes and key.
  Following the prior root was especially harmful because consecutive chords
  generally have the discourtesy to change.

- **Let recent spellings steer the choice between sharps and flats.** The first
  version had one lucky setting and failed everywhere around it. A stronger
  version was stable but still too small to adopt. An F-sharp-versus-G-flat
  preference even looked significant only because one corpus happened to contain
  more music written in F-sharp. Evidence from a second musical domain later
  justified the narrow default that shipped.

- **Use the next chord to revise an earlier ambiguous name.** It could correct
  one kind of ambiguity with perfect precision, but touched too little music to
  improve key detection. The general feedback idea died; a later, narrower use
  of history survived because some rootless names depended on the detector's
  next key claim.

- **Use surrounding harmony to improve note spelling.** Once the key itself was
  correct, spelling was already about 99.4% right. Almost the entire remaining
  gap came from detecting the wrong key, which no clever speller can repair.

- **Teach the analyzer to ignore melody notes.** A benchmark seemed to show a
  large error class where melody notes pushed the app toward bigger chord names,
  so we considered filtering them out. Counting only notes that sounded at the
  same moment shrank the bucket from 22.8% of events to 1.1%: the original view
  had assembled a melodic line into imaginary chords. Little remained for the
  rule to fix.

- **Add classical augmented-sixth names.** Scores call these sounds
  [augmented sixths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_sixth_chord); the
  app deliberately uses lead-sheet dominant-seventh names. Adding the classical
  reading, even as an alternative, required a new chord family or contextual
  spelling rule for a difference affecting about 0.7% of events in the classical
  corpus. It did not clear the bar.

- **Resolve the remaining rootless chords with better tiebreakers.** Ensemble
  mode misnamed rootless chords that pointed outside the current key, so we
  planned smarter rules for choosing the intended missing root. But the correct
  reading was never generated. No tiebreaker can pick a candidate that does not
  exist; the successful fix expanded the candidate pool, then guarded against
  implausible readings.

### Surely real piano input has an obvious fix

These came from the
[Performed Input](https://github.com/EarthmanMuons/whatchord/tree/main/research/performed-input)
initiative, which replayed real performances through the app's live analysis
path.

- **Wait longer before showing a chord.** Making a name earn its place by
  surviving a fixed delay calmed the display briefly and then started eating
  real music: at half a second of required stillness, 57% of the chords played
  never reached the screen at all. Short and ornamented chords cannot outlast
  the wait.

- **Ignore pedal-held notes.** The filter successfully removed pedal blur and
  also removed the harmony, because pianists use the pedal to hold real chords
  while their hands move. Coverage collapsed and accuracy fell.

- **Match the analyst's root.** In many disagreements the app chose the sounding
  bass while a
  [Roman-numeral analyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral_analysis)
  chose an implied functional root. That was a difference between naming
  cultures, not an engine defect, so we declined to optimize the app away from
  its stated audience.

- **Re-rank the app's existing alternatives.** We hoped the analyst's chord was
  already ranked second. For nine tenths of the time they disagreed, it was not
  among the close alternatives at all, leaving the cheap re-ranking idea almost
  no target.

- **Treat the highest extra note as melody.** The extra tone was actually on top
  only about a quarter of the time. The honest version would require tracking
  several musical voices through time, a substantial project for a small
  measured ceiling.

- **Expand the test pool with real octave layouts.** Across nearly eight
  thousand observed layouts, the engine kept the same name 99.3% of the time.
  Textbook stacks were not hiding a sensitivity to how a chord gets spread
  across the keyboard.

- **Show a "settling" indicator while the name is still firming up.** The
  display now waits about a fifth of a second for the app's own capture
  machinery to commit a chord, which is what finally calmed the flicker. An
  indicator for that wait would have fired 73 to 168 times a minute, putting the
  flicker straight back as decoration.

- **Change how the benchmark awards partial credit.** We tried judging the app's
  answer by the chord tones the pianist had played, rather than every tone
  implied by the app's chosen name. It rescued four seconds of credit on the
  intended augmented-sixth cases and cost 274 seconds on ordinary incomplete
  performances. The trade was overwhelmingly negative, so we kept the original
  scoring.

### Surely one pricing tweak or extra chord name will do it

The
[Tone Pricing](https://github.com/EarthmanMuons/whatchord/tree/main/research/tone-pricing)
initiative and
[ChoCo coverage study](https://github.com/EarthmanMuons/whatchord/blob/main/research/choco-chord-coverage.md)
tested these ideas against real playing time and more than a million chord
annotations. The pricing questions all come back to the
[explanation cost](chord-recognition-algorithm.html): core chord tones are free,
and a name pays for everything else it asks a reader to accept.

- **Make unexplained notes cheaper.** This helped half-played simple chords, not
  the target cases where melody or pedal notes were absorbed into fancy names.
  Pushing farther made the analyzer lazily ignore the notes that make a chord
  interesting.

- **Charge rare fancy names more.** Combined with the cheaper unexplained tone
  above, this package broke curated musical judgments, including the canonical
  [minor-major seventh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_major_seventh_chord)
  in harmonic minor, and was reverted under its predeclared rule.

- **Charge rare names more except when the key makes them conventional.** The
  app already had a rule protecting the textbook harmonic-minor case, but the
  price hike pushed the candidates too far apart for that rule to apply.
  Exempting that context would also exempt most of the errors the change was
  meant to fix, leaving almost nothing to gain. Clever, measured, empty.

- **Add every label found in a large corpus.**
  [When we checked our vocabulary against that corpus](million-chord-annotations.html),
  the long tail turned out to be dominated by root-only and fifth-only labels,
  omissions, and rare spellings. Broad expansion risked making common names
  harder to rank, so most of that vocabulary stayed out. One tightly contained
  omitted-third dominant shell earned its way in; the general theory did not.

## What the failures bought

This is not a graveyard of wasted work. Negative experiments produced the
performance replay tools, paired comparison machinery, exposure-weighted chord
pools, provenance tracking for held versus pedaled notes, frozen corpora, and
behavioral suites. All of it now guards every later change.

They also pointed toward several wins. Removing clever key-evidence layers made
the shipped detector simpler. Measuring flicker moved the solution from chord
analysis into display policy. Discovering that an ensemble candidate was absent,
not badly ranked, led to the real fix. Testing a cold-start prior exposed that
the waiting gate itself was unnecessary.

The discipline is what lets a result be surprising without becoming negotiable.
We can like an idea, implement it correctly, watch it move the exact mechanism
we predicted, and still decline it because the app as a whole gets worse. We can
also change our minds later when a new measurement shows that the mechanism
belongs in a narrower job.

## The point of keeping the receipts

Positive results are naturally preserved: they become code, release notes, and
screenshots. Negative results disappear unless preserving them is an explicit
part of the method. Once they disappear, every plausible idea becomes new again.

So we keep the protocol, the split, the command, the correction, and the result
that hurt our feelings. A future contributor can reproduce the number, challenge
the premise, add a better corpus, or show that a once-useless mechanism now has
a job. Until then, we know more than "it felt wrong."

We know exactly how wrong we were. Within a 95% confidence interval.
