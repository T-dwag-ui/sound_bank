## Why wall-clock time lies

WhatChord names the chord you are playing, in real time, from the notes arriving
over a MIDI connection. The part that does the naming,
[the analysis engine](chord-recognition-algorithm.html), runs on every change to
the keys you are holding, so it sits on a _hot path_: code that runs constantly
and has to stay fast. When we set out to make it faster, we hit a problem before
changing a line. We could not trust our own measurements.

The problem fits in one number. Some of the
[ranking optimizations](chord-ranking-performance.html) were worth about 4%. On
a hot path that is worth shipping, but it is smaller than the run-to-run
variation an ordinary laptop shows when a background task wakes up
mid-benchmark, and far smaller than the gap between two CI runners of different
vintages. Wall-clock time is hardware-dependent and noisy, and a benchmark that
reports raw milliseconds cannot tell an improvement from a runner that was less
busy that minute.

The clean fix is to control the hardware: a dedicated benchmark machine with its
CPU frequency locked and nothing else running. Tools like
[Cachegrind](https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cg-manual.html) and
[poop](https://github.com/andrewrk/poop) sidestep timing altogether by counting
instructions instead, simulated in one case and read from hardware performance
counters in the other. Both are worth using when you can. We could not justify
dedicated hardware for one app's benchmark, and we wanted numbers that a
contributor's laptop and a rented CI runner could both reproduce, so we went the
other way: make the numbers themselves far less hardware-dependent.

What follows is the toolkit we landed on: exact operation counts wherever
possible, and for the time you still have to measure, a reference-workload
ratio, adaptive sampling, a calibrated noise model, and a regression gate that
separates statistical significance from practical significance. Our harness
lives in
[`benchmark/`](https://github.com/EarthmanMuons/whatchord/tree/main/benchmark)
and replays fixed inputs through `ChordAnalyzer.analyze`, but nothing below is
specific to chords. It does assume a workload like ours, though: CPU-bound,
deterministic, and in-process. The counters transfer anywhere, but
reference-workload normalization has little to offer when the bottleneck is I/O,
the network, or a user interface rather than the CPU the reference measures.

## Count operations before you time anything

Timing, however carefully sampled, is fundamentally analog. The most valuable
measurements in the harness are the ones that are not timed at all:
deterministic counters of the work the algorithm does.

The recipe is to give each stage of your pipeline a counter for its unit of
work. Ours count cache hits and misses, roots considered, templates evaluated,
candidates produced, and candidates ranked; yours might count nodes visited,
rows scanned, or bytes hashed. These are integers that depend only on the input
and the code, never on the hardware. On a fixed corpus, any change to a counter
is a real algorithmic change, full stop, with zero noise to argue about.

Counters also move before milliseconds do. A scan that quietly stops being
incremental, a cache that stops hitting, a prune that drops too much: each shows
up as an exact changed integer long before it surfaces as a bump in a noisy time
series. That makes them a semantic regression check as much as a performance
metric, catching the unintended algorithm change that timing would have absorbed
into its error bars.

They can cost nothing in production. Ours sit behind a compile-time flag and are
stripped out entirely by the compiler in normal builds. Most compiled languages
have an equivalent switch, whether a `const` in Dart, a `cfg` attribute in Rust,
or the preprocessor in C.

    An example from our engine, which first generates candidate chord
    names for the notes being played and then ranks them, with ranking
    dominating the cost. When we later
    <a href="chord-ranking-performance.html"
      >pruned low-scoring candidates before ranking</a
    >, two counters on a fixed corpus told the story:
    <code>candidatesRanked</code> fell from 11,983 to 2,120 while
    <code>candidatesProduced</code> held exactly still, corroborating
    that generation did the same amount of work. Golden tests, cases
    with pinned expected output, proved the results themselves had not
    changed. The largest performance change we have shipped is
    recorded as exact, hardware-independent integers.
  </p>
</div>

## Normalize time to a reference workload

What counters cannot see is a constant-factor win: the same operations, executed
faster. For that you still need time, and the key move is to stop reporting time
and start reporting a _ratio_. Alongside the code under test, the harness times
a fixed reference workload on the same machine, in the same run, and divides:

<pre><code><span class="cm">// Both are timed on the same machine, in the same process.</span>
<span class="kw">final</span> normalized = engineTime / referenceTime;</code></pre>

A slower machine inflates both the numerator and the denominator, so the ratio
holds roughly constant. The result is dimensionless: "the engine took this many
reference-workloads of time." That number is comparable across machines in a way
milliseconds never are, which is what lets a baseline recorded on one machine
judge a run on another, at least between machines of the same broad class.

The reference should burn the same resource your hot path burns. Ours is a fixed
amount of integer arithmetic that allocates no memory, chosen because the engine
is compute-bound: the reference tracks raw CPU speed without dragging in the
[garbage collector](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)>)
or memory bandwidth. If your hot path is memory-bound, an integer loop is the
wrong yardstick, and the reference should stream memory the same way your code
does.

Be clear-eyed about what the ratio cancels. It removes hardware differences only
to the degree that the code under test responds to hardware the same way the
reference does, and a real engine also touches allocation, branch prediction,
and cache, so two machines with a different balance of memory speed to compute
speed will disagree a little even on the ratio. In practice the ratio absorbs
the first-order difference between machines, raw CPU speed, and leaves a much
smaller residual. The counters catch what the ratio misses on the algorithmic
side, and the noise model below keeps the residual from raising false alarms.

## Decide what the benchmark exercises

If the code under test has a cache, the cache-hit rate of your input set
silently becomes a parameter of the benchmark. Split the paths and report them
separately:

- **Cold:** every call a cache miss, the full pipeline every time. The worst
  case and the most sensitive regression signal.
- **Warm:** every call a hit, served from the engine's LRU cache of recent
  results. It stays near zero at any scale and serves only as a "the cache is
  working" sanity line, not a tuning target.

The input sets deserve the same scrutiny, because "is it faster?" and "is it
faster on the cases that matter?" are different questions. We replay two
corpora: an **oracle corpus** of hand-reviewed, deliberately nasty voicings
borrowed from our correctness test suite, and a **common voicing pool** of
everyday chord types across their inversions, approximating real playing. The
benchmark replays only the voicings; their known-correct answers stay with the
tests, which own correctness. The standing rule is to never judge a change by
the stress corpus alone. A slowdown that only shows up on 12-note chromatic
clusters is worth knowing about, but it should not be confused with one that
touches a <span class="chord">Cmaj7</span>.

## Memory, in three numbers

A single "memory used" figure misleads, because raw byte counts move for reasons
unrelated to the code under test: runtime overhead, allocator and
garbage-collection timing, the measurement channel itself. In any
garbage-collected runtime, three numbers with distinct meanings work better than
one total:

- **churn:** total memory allocated during the run, counting objects created and
  then immediately thrown away. This is what makes work for the garbage
  collector, and the number that matters most while the code under test is
  mostly stateless.
- **retained:** how much the live heap grew from before the run to after it,
  measured after forcing a garbage collection so only genuinely-kept memory
  counts. This approximates what the run held onto; for us, mostly the
  analyzer's cache.
- **live heap:** the total memory in use by the whole process. A useful check on
  overall footprint, but it includes runtime and benchmark state, not just the
  code under test.

Every managed runtime exposes the raw material for these. We read them through
the Dart VM's service protocol; the JVM, V8, and Go all have equivalent
channels.

## Sampling until the number stops moving

A single timing is meaningless, and the usual reflex, running the benchmark some
round number of times and averaging, is only half a fix: the right sample count
depends on variance you cannot know in advance, and an average alone says
nothing about how trustworthy it is.

So our harness samples adaptively, in the spirit of benchmarking tools like
[hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) and
[Criterion](https://github.com/criterion-rs/criterion.rs). After a few warmup
runs to let the just-in-time compiler finish optimizing the hot code, it keeps
sampling until the 95%
[confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval) on the
mean (a normal approximation) is within 1.5% of the mean, bounded by a run cap
and a time budget so the expensive cold pass still finishes. The 1.5% is a
stopping ceiling, not the precision you get; on a quiet machine the sampler
settles well below it.

Each measurement reports mean, median, standard deviation, min and max, the
sample count, the confidence interval it reached, and whether it settled or hit
a limit. Operations too fast for the clock, like the sub-microsecond warm pass,
are timed in batches of many calls per clock read, or they vanish beneath the
timer's resolution. And the published number is the normalized score, a ratio of
two sampled quantities, so both halves contribute uncertainty. The two combine
_in quadrature_, as the square root of the sum of their squares, which is the
standard statistical way to merge two independent sources of error.

## Calibrating the noise you can't sample away

Separate invocations of the same benchmark on the same machine drift more than
the in-process confidence interval suggests, due to runtime memory layout,
thermal state, CPU scheduling, and whatever else the host is doing. A check that
trusted only the in-process interval would flag a regression on any slightly
warmer run.

The fix is to measure that drift directly. The harness's calibration mode
launches the full benchmark repeatedly as separate subprocesses, compares each
run to the baseline, and builds a per-metric noise estimate from the spread of
the relative deltas. It runs at least 10 subprocesses, continuing until every
metric's estimate changes by less than 10% from the previous iteration, capped
at 50 runs. Robust statistics matter here, because the occasional extreme run is
exactly what a busy host produces:

<pre><code>noiseRel95   = <span class="nu">1.96</span> * <span class="nu">1.4826</span> * <span class="fn">medianAbsoluteDeviation</span>(relativeDeltas)

combined     = <span class="fn">sqrt</span>(baselineCI² + currentCI² + noiseRel95²)</code></pre>

Unpacking the first line: the `1.96` is the standard 95% factor for a normal
distribution, and the
[median absolute deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation)
(MAD) is a measure of spread that, unlike the standard deviation, is barely
affected by the occasional extreme run; the `1.4826` rescales the MAD so it
lines up with a standard deviation on normally-distributed data. Like the
per-run confidence interval, this is a model-based tolerance rather than
measured coverage: it assumes roughly normal noise and deliberately deweights
rare extreme runs, so treat the 95% as a design target, not a promise. The
second line, the calibrated noise combined with both runs' sampling confidence
intervals in quadrature, is the uncertainty window that regression checks
measure against.

One rule keeps the model honest: a noise model describes only the class of
machine it was calibrated on. A model built on a laptop says nothing about the
variance of a hosted CI runner, whose shared tenancy and throttling are a noise
profile of their own. Calibrate on the machine class that will run your
regression checks, and recalibrate when that changes.

## Gate on two thresholds, not one

A baseline is only useful if something checks against it. The harness records a
baseline file in the repository, holding the normalized scores, counters, and
memory numbers, and compares every later run against it, failing loudly when a
metric regresses. That comparison is the gate, and the design point worth
stealing is that it separates statistical significance from practical
significance. A change can be statistically real and still too small to care
about; it can look large and still sit inside the noise. A run fails only when
both tests trip:

- **Time** fails when it is slower than the baseline by at least 5% _and_ falls
  outside the combined uncertainty window.
- **Memory** fails when it grows by at least 3%, clears a small absolute floor,
  and exceeds the calibrated noise when a model is available.
- **Counters** fail on any deterministic increase, because there is no noise to
  forgive.

The practical thresholds are a product decision, not a statistical one: pick the
smallest regression you would actually act on. The statistical window comes from
the machinery above, and exists only to keep the gate from crying wolf. And
trust the gate only on a machine class you have calibrated; anywhere else, treat
the numbers as advisory.

## Measuring the measuring tool

One last trap: the benchmark measuring itself. A clock has finite resolution,
and a timed quantity becomes unreliable as it shrinks toward that floor. So when
normalized scores land at awkward magnitudes and you go looking for nicer
numbers, keep measurement stability and display magnitude as separate decisions,
and never buy readability by shrinking your yardstick into the timer's
resolution.

We hit the trap after a big optimization landed. The normalized scores shrank so
far, to around 0.099 on one corpus and 0.020 on the other, that they were
awkward to read and compare at a glance. A normalized score is a dimensionless
ratio, so its magnitude is arbitrary and free to rescale; the question was how.
There are two levers: the **reference workload size**, which sets measurement
stability, and a **display multiplier**, which sets the printed magnitude. The
tempting shortcut is to use only the workload size, shrinking it until the ratio
lands where you want.

That fails because of timer resolution. The harness reads the clock in whole
microseconds, so any single timing is rounded to the nearest microsecond (its
_quantization_). To push the larger score up near 100 for readability by
shrinking the workload alone, the reference would have to run in about 8
microseconds, which is only about 8 of those rounding steps wide. The reference
would become the dominant source of noise, defeating its whole purpose as the
stable yardstick.

So we measured reliability against workload size directly, 400 samples at each
size, to find how small the workload can get before resolution and jitter start
to dominate:

<table class="score-table">

      <td class="mono">0.012%</td>
      <td class="mono">0.13%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Two things fall out. First, the binding noise is OS scheduling jitter, not timer
resolution: the per-sample spread stays essentially flat as the workload shrinks
from 4M down to 400k iterations, while the quantization floor stays two orders
of magnitude below it. Only when a single sample drops under a couple hundred
microseconds do resolution and jitter start to bite.

Second, that makes **400k iterations (about 0.8 ms) the smallest workload that
stays reliable.** At that size our larger score sits near 1.0, which makes the
display multiplier a clean **×100**: the scores land as readable
two-to-three-digit integers, with downward headroom as the code keeps getting
faster. The rescale is purely cosmetic. A uniform factor leaves every relative
delta, every confidence interval, and every regression decision exactly where it
was.

## What it buys

The payoff is that performance changes get settled with numbers instead of
guesswork. The counters catch algorithmic changes with zero noise. The
reference-normalized, adaptively sampled time catches changes large enough to
matter, and the noise model keeps the gate from firing on the ones that don't. A
baseline file in the repo means a change from a year ago and a change from today
are measured on nearly the same footing, even on different hardware.

For us, that is what made the ranking optimization work legible: a 4% per-pair
win and an 87% pruning win were both visible and both trustworthy, and the dead
ends were provably dead because the counters said the work had not budged and
the golden tests said the output had not either. None of it needed hardware we
control, which was the point.
