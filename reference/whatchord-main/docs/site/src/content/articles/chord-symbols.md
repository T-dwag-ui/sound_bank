## Naming, Writing, and Playing

Three related questions are easy to conflate: what are these notes called, what
symbol should I write to suggest this chord, and what will a player do with what
I wrote? This guide answers the first: given a set of notes, which symbol names
them.

The other two allow more latitude. The notes D-G-A-C are exactly
<span class="chord">D7sus4</span>, but a lead sheet might write
<span class="chord">D7sus</span>, or even <span class="chord">Dsus</span>,
trusting the reader to fill in the seventh. A performer, in turn, may voice any
of these freely; jazz players will happily hang a seventh on anything.

Identification favors the precise name. Where a choice remains, we lean toward
what a musician expects to read, not the loosest shorthand a setting allows.

## Symbol Structure

A symbol has three parts:

<div class="symbol-parts">
  <div class="symbol-part">
    <span class="symbol-part-label">Root</span>
    <span class="symbol-part-example">C</span>
  </div>
  <span class="symbol-part-join">+</span>
  <div class="symbol-part">
    <span class="symbol-part-label">Quality &amp; extensions</span>
    <span class="symbol-part-example">maj7</span>
  </div>
  <span class="symbol-part-join">+</span>
  <div class="symbol-part symbol-part-optional">
    <span class="symbol-part-label"
      >Slash bass <span class="symbol-part-opt">optional</span></span
    >
    <span class="symbol-part-example">/ E</span>
  </div>
</div>

Examples include <span class="chord">C</span>, <span class="chord">Cm7</span>,
<span class="chord">C13♭9</span>, and <span class="chord">Cmaj7 / E</span>.

The root and bass are spelled to fit the current tonal context. The middle
portion is formatted from the identified chord quality and extensions. Spelling
and notation preferences, including enharmonic respellings chosen for
convenience, change how the symbol looks without changing the underlying sense
of root.

Two common notation styles are available. Before extensions and alterations are
added, chord symbols start from these base quality labels:

</table>

In everyday practice these are not sealed systems; musicians often mix them,
writing a dash for a minor chord but spelling out `maj7`, or reaching for `°`
and `ø7` while leaving the rest textual.

The examples below use textual notation throughout.

## Extensions vs. Added Tones

The seventh is what turns an upper note into an extension. With a seventh
present, a natural ninth, eleventh, or thirteenth continues the
[tertian stack](chord-naming.html) and is named as an extension. Without the
seventh, that same note is an _added tone_, written with `add`, and implies no
seventh: <span class="chord">C9</span> has a seventh, while
<span class="chord">Cadd9</span> does not.

- A natural ninth is `9` when the chord has a seventh, otherwise `add9`.
- A natural eleventh is `11` when the chord has a seventh, otherwise `add11`.
- A natural thirteenth is `13` when the chord has a seventh, otherwise `6` (see
  below).

The lower members of the extensions are optional: a
<span class="chord">C11</span> may omit its ninth, and a
<span class="chord">C13</span> its ninth and eleventh.

The highest extension present is promoted into the main symbol. Any present
lower extension is folded in rather than spelled out separately, while
alterations stay explicit. So a dominant thirteenth with a flat ninth and sharp
eleventh is <span class="chord">C13(♭9,♯11)</span>.

### Sixth Chords

The seventh is what makes a chord a thirteenth rather than a sixth. With no
seventh, a major or minor triad with the sixth degree is a sixth chord,
<span class="chord">C6</span> or <span class="chord">Cm6</span>; adding a ninth
gives the conventional <span class="chord">C6/9</span>.

### Why not add2 or add4?

Chord symbols say nothing about register, so an added tone's label never changes
with its voicing: a D added to a C triad is the same ninth whether it sits next
to the root or an octave above, and an F is the same eleventh either way. There
is no need to drop to <code class="not-used">add2</code> or
<code class="not-used">add4</code> just because a note happens to be voiced
close to the root.

Register independence rules out voicing-based switching, but it does not by
itself favor `add9` over <code class="not-used">add2</code>, or `add11` over
<code class="not-used">add4</code>, since each pair ignores register equally. No
strict rule settles the choice; `add9` and `add11` simply prevail as the common
convention.

`sus2` and `sus4` remain distinct because they describe replacement of the
third, not merely an added tone.

## Alterations

Altered upper extensions are written explicitly: `♭9`, `♯9`, `♯11`, and `♭13`.
Here `♭` and `♯` mean lowered or raised by a semitone from the natural
extension, using whatever accidental the spelling requires; a `♭9` does not
necessarily carry a literal flat on the note. When a triad has an altered ninth
without the harmonic support for a stacked extension, the symbol can use `add♭9`
or `add♯9`.

An altered fifth that defines the base quality normally stays with that quality
label. It is usually inline, as in <span class="chord">C7♭5</span>,
<span class="chord">Cmaj7♯5</span>, and <span class="chord">Cm♯5</span>. The
exception is a bare major triad with a flat five: inline,
<span class="chord not-used">C♭5</span> risks reading as a C-flat root rather
than a lowered fifth, so the altered fifth is parenthesized as
<span class="chord">C(♭5)</span>. The parenthesized half-diminished spelling
<span class="chord">Cm7(♭5)</span> is a conventional form kept for familiarity,
much like <span class="chord">C6/9</span>.

When such a chord also carries other modifiers, the altered fifth joins them in
the single trailing group rather than running the accidentals together or
stranding a second set of parentheses: a dominant seventh with a flat five and a
flat nine is <span class="chord">C7(♭5,♭9)</span>, and an extended
half-diminished chord is <span class="chord">Cm9(♭5,♭13)</span>, not
<span class="chord not-used">Cm9(♭5)♭13</span>.

Modifiers are ordered consistently by musical degree: ninths, elevenths, then
thirteenths, with alterations placed alongside their degree.

## Parentheses

This guide reserves parentheses for grouping and disambiguation. They are one of
the least standardized parts of chord symbol notation, used for all sorts of
purposes depending on the source. Some teaching styles, such as Berklee-derived
materials, parenthesize every tension and alteration as a rule, as in
<span class="chord not-used">C7(♯11)</span>, where we prefer to keep a lone
alteration inline as <span class="chord">C7♯11</span>.

A symbol carries _at most one parenthesized group_, placed at the end, so
parentheses never appear in the middle of the label or as two separate groups. A
group forms only where running the modifiers inline would be ambiguous or hard
to read:

- Multiple modifiers are grouped: <span class="chord">C7(♭9,♯11)</span>.
- Modifiers on suspended seventh chords are grouped rather than run onto the
  suspension: <span class="chord">C7sus4(♭13)</span>.
- In textual notation, added tones after the spelled-out `aug` and `dim` labels
  are grouped so the words do not run into `add`:
  <span class="chord">Cdim(add9)</span> is clearer than
  <span class="chord not-used">Cdimadd9</span>.
- An altered fifth carried in the quality label joins the group when other
  modifiers are present: <span class="chord">C7(♭5,♭9)</span> and
  <span class="chord">Cm9(♭5,♭13)</span>.
- Textual minor-major symbols write the major seventh or promoted major
  extension inside the group, with any other modifiers joining it:
  <span class="chord">Cm(maj7)</span>, <span class="chord">Cm(maj9)</span>, and
  <span class="chord">Cm(maj9,♭13)</span>.
- A lone upper-extension modifier after promoted `maj11` or `maj13` is grouped
  because the two-digit promoted label is already dense:
  <span class="chord">Cmaj11(♭13)</span> and
  <span class="chord">Cmaj13(♯11)</span>.
- Bare altered colors after a plain major root are grouped so the accidental
  belongs to the extension, not the root: <span class="chord">C(♯11)</span>.
- A promoted extension after an accidental root is grouped for the opposite
  reason, so the root accidental remains clear:
  <span class="chord">C♯(11)</span> and <span class="chord">F♯(13,♯11)</span>.

Where concatenation is already clear, the modifiers stay inline. A single
ordinary modifier needs no group: <span class="chord">C7♭9</span>,
<span class="chord">C13♯11</span>, <span class="chord">Cmaj9♯11</span>, or
<span class="chord">Cadd♯9</span>. An added tone reads cleanly inline after a
label that already ends in a self-contained mark: the bare root
(<span class="chord">Cadd9</span>), the fused `m`
(<span class="chord">Cmadd11</span>), and the symbolic quality signs `+` and `°`
(<span class="chord" >C+add13</span >).

Textual notation separates grouped modifiers with commas for readability, as in
<span class="chord">C13(♭9,♯11)</span>. Symbolic notation omits them for
compactness, writing the same chord as <span class="chord">C13(♭9♯11)</span>,
since the accidentals already mark where each modifier begins.

## Omissions

Omission markers such as <code class="not-used">no5</code> do appear in
practice, but this guide avoids them as formatting. For the purpose of
communicating an identity, they add visual noise without changing which chord is
named. Commonly omitted tones, especially perfect fifths in extended chords,
should be understood as part of that chord's identity rather than turned into a
performance instruction.

Dropping the third is a different matter, because the third is much of what a
name claims. A bare root, fifth, and flat seventh (the jazz shell voicing D-A-C)
functions as a dominant seventh while sounding no third at all, and writing it
as a plain <span class="chord">D7</span> would assert a major third that never
sounded. Here the omission is the identity information rather than a performance
instruction, so the marker earns its place:
<span class="chord">D7(omit3)</span>.

The spelling follows the copyist standard. Brandt and Roemer's _Standardized
Chord Symbol Notation_ shows exactly this symbol and prefers "omit" over "no".
The word "no" already carries a meaning in printed music, the abbreviation for
"number" (Op. 59, No. 3), so <code class="not-used">no3</code> leaves a
misreading available. "Omit" has one meaning, belongs to the same instruction
vocabulary as tacet and simile, and reads without hesitation. The same standard
also draws the boundary this guide keeps: once additional colors join a shell,
the compound reading (a slash chord) communicates better than an omission
symbol, so the marker stays reserved for the bare shell alone.

## Slash Bass

The slash note names the sounding bass under the chord symbol. It does not
change the root, and it does not make the bass note a second chord symbol. A
voicing with E in the bass and a C major seventh above it is therefore
<span class="chord">Cmaj7 / E</span>, not an E-rooted chord
[unless the notes support that analysis more strongly](why-chord-naming-is-hard.html#inversions-the-bass-note-changes-everything).

Slash bass also affects which chord tones need to be named explicitly. If an
added-tone label would only repeat the bass note, that label is omitted. For
example, prefer <span class="chord">A♭7 / D♭</span> over the redundant
<span class="chord not-used">A♭7(add11) / D♭</span>. Only added tones compress
this way; an alteration keeps its label even when the bass supplies that note,
so a half-diminished chord with its lowered thirteenth in the bass is still
<span class="chord">Em7(♭5,♭13) / C</span>, not
<span class="chord not-used">Em7(♭5) / C</span>.

The same principle keeps slash-bass symbols from overstating stacked extensions.
A ninth only earns its place in the main symbol when the chord truly carries it,
so a ninth that comes from the bass alone stays in the bass:
<span class="chord">C7 / D</span>, not <span class="chord not-used">C9 /
D</span>. The seventh belongs to the quality rather than the extensions, so it
never drops out this way and <span class="chord">C7 / B♭</span> stays
<span class="chord">C7 / B♭</span>.

The slash note names the pitch a player sounds, so it favors a readable
spelling. When the bass is a genuine chord tone, its conventional inversion
spelling is kept, even where that means a less common letter, as with
<span class="chord">C♯maj7 / B♯</span>. But when the bass is a color or altered
tone, the sounding spelling wins, so a sharp ninth in the bass is
<span class="chord">A7(♯9) / C</span>, not <span class="chord not-used">A7(♯9) /
B♯</span>, and double accidentals are avoided.
