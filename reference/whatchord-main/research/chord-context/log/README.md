# Chord-Context Log

Dated entries recording what was tried, what happened, and what was decided,
following the WhatKey log conventions (`research/whatkey/log/README.md`): one
file per session, experiment, or significant decision, named
`YYYY-MM-DD-NN-short-slug.md`; entries are append-only and must record enough to
reproduce (engine commit, fixture version, exact commands verbatim); negative
results get entries too; jargon-heavy entries include a Plain-English reading
section.

## Entry template

```markdown
# YYYY-MM-DD: Title

**Goal.** What question this session tried to answer.

**Setup.** Engine commit, fixture version, corpus pins, parameters.

**What happened.** Actions and results, with numbers.

**Plain-English reading.** (When the entry is jargon- or statistics-heavy.) What
the numbers mean for a reader without the background.

**Decisions.** What was decided and why, including alternatives rejected.

**Next.** Open threads this creates or closes.
