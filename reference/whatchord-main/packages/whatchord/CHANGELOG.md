## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial extraction of the WhatChord analysis engine into a standalone pure
  Dart package: chord identification (`ChordAnalyzer`), ranked candidates with
  explanation traces, note spelling, scale harmonization and degree
  classification, chord construction from a selected spec, and formatters for
  chord symbols, spoken names, long-form names, and Harte notation.
- Temporal module: `ChordEvent` (a committed chord from live play) and
  `ChordEventSegmenter`, the capture model that feeds key detection and future
  temporal-context analysis.
